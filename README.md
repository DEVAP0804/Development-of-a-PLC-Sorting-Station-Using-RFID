# Development-of-a-PLC-Sorting-Station-Using-RFID
The PLC Sorting Station Using RFID project automates object sorting in industrial settings. By integrating RFID technology with a Siemens S7-1500 PLC and Node-RED, it enables real-time tracking and efficient sorting based on unique RFID tags. This solution enhances accuracy, reduces manual labor, and optimizes operations across various industries.
