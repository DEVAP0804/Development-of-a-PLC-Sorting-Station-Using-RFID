Hardware Components
Siemens S7-1500 PLC
ESP32 Module
RFID Reader
RFID Tags
Two Double-Acting Solenoid Valves
Five Sensors
Four Conveyors
Software Setup
Node-RED: Ensure Node-RED is installed. Installation Guide
PLC Environment: Install TIA Portal or your preferred PLC programming environment.
Usage
Ensure all hardware components are connected as per the wiring diagrams provided in the docs folder.
Power on the system and start Node-RED.
Place objects with RFID tags on the conveyor; the system will automatically sort them based on predefined criteria.
Testing and Results
The sorting station has been tested to ensure accurate RFID tag reading and effective sorting. Detailed results and performance metrics are documented in the tests folder.

Troubleshooting
Issue: RFID reader not detecting tags.
Solution: Check connections and ensure tags are within the reader's range.
Issue: Solenoid valve not activating.
Solution: Verify the PLC code and ensure the correct signals are being sent from the ESP32.
Future Work
Explore additional automation features, such as predictive sorting based on historical data.
Expand the system to handle a broader range of objects and sorting criteria.
Integrate machine learning algorithms for enhanced decision-making.
